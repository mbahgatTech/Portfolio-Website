In my summer of 2022 co-op work term placement, I have worked with Scales Nature Park to **implement a better data entry system for wildlife conservation purposes** and **develop a set of automation tools used for data management on google sheets.**

Getting into this position, I've had minimal JavaScript experience developing an [SVG Image Viewer](https://svg-image-viewer.herokuapp.com/) website as a part of a school project at the University of Guelph. In order to achieve my work tasks, I had to develop effective strategies to learn new software frameworks and concepts. 

## Data Entry System Project
I led a small team of 2 developers in the development of a data entry system for wildlife conservation data collection as the main project during my employment. The system consists of a mobile data entry application where: 
- Users can enter observation data of reptiles and amphibians spotted in the wild during field surverys. 
- Users can save data entries to device while offline and edit it and/or submit it for database storage later when they get an internet connection.  
- Users can share saved or uploaded data entries with other users.
- Users can search for uploaded data entries using specific criteria.

and a desktop admin application where:
- Users can update mobile app user credentials, delete accounts and give or revoke permissions from users to use certain features on the app like searching or submitting data to the database.
- Users can update and delete the data entry fields that are displayed in the data entry form on the mobile app.
- Users can update and delete submitted data entries to the database.
